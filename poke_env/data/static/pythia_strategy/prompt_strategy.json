{
    "tinglu": "Ting-Lu is a solid defensive tank that can be used to answer threats like Dragapult, Gholdengo, and Raging Bolt. Rest allows Ting-Lu to fully utilize its walling potential giving it more longevity than it otherwise would have, which makes it much more consistent against foes such as Will-O-Wisp Dragapult while helping with longevity versus hazards in the face of foes like opposing Ting-Lu. Ruination is used to chunk switch-ins such as Landorus-T and provide consistent damage. Payback, an alternative to Ruination, allows Ting-Lu to deal damage to foes weak to Dark, namely Dragapult. Sleep Talk's reduced passivity makes Ting-Lu harder to set up on, creating fewer free turns for Pokemon such as Kingambit and Dragonite. This also prevents foes like Ogerpon-W from getting free opportunities to come in, as it may call Ruination. At the cost of being a bit more passive, Ting-Lu can forgo Sleep Talk to run Stealth Rock and form entry hazard stacking cores with Pokemon such as Spikes Gliscor and enable teammates such as Dragonite, Ogerpon-W, and Zamazenta. Tera Water allows Ting-Lu to deal with moves from foes such as Kyurem and Hisuian Samurott. Tera Poison enables it to become immune to poison from foes it likes to switch into such as Galarian Slowking while enabling it to come in and out to absorb Toxic Spikes. Furthermore, it allows Ting-Lu to handle Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant and Grass-type moves from Rillaboom and Ogerpon-W.",
    "cinderace": "In a metagame dominated by entry hazards, Cinderace thrives as a pivot thanks to its unique utility options in Court Change and Will-O-Wisp, and Libero granting it a plethora of high-power STAB options such as Gunk Shot and Pyro Ball. Its excellent base 119 Speed allows it to outpace opposing offensive threats like Ogerpon-W, Iron Crown, and Great Tusk. U-turn both brings in teammates and chips down foes that come in on Cinderace, like Great Tusk, Dondozo, and Raging Bolt, while dealing super effective damage to the likes of Hisuian Samurott and Ting-Lu. Court Change allows Cinderace to remove hazards, even against Gholdengo, as well as steal opposing Aurora Veil. Will-O-Wisp is used to weaken and burn opposing threats such as the aforementioned Great Tusk as well as Pokemon like Kingambit, Dragonite, and Zamazenta. Libero-boosted Sucker Punch can be opted to give Cinderace a useful priority option, allowing it to pick off offensive threats such as Dragapult and Choice Scarf Gholdengo after chip damage. Libero-boosted Gunk Shot gives Cinderace a powerful coverage tool, able to OHKO the likes of Enamorus and Primarina, as well as Hatterene after Spikes while also slamming other foes wanting to come in on Cinderace such as Raging Bolt. Low Kick is an additional option that might be worth considering to 2HKO Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, Garganacl, and Kyurem, as well as OHKO Kingambit, which Pyro Ball does not offer. While Cinderace often doesn't have to use Terastallization thanks to its good natural typing and Libero letting it change its own typing naturally, Tera Fire is able to give Pyro Ball a massive power boost, letting it 2HKO even the likes of Zamazenta without its Dauntless Shield and specially defensive Gliscor, whereas Tera Flying lets it turn the tables on Ground- and Fighting-types, letting it get a Will-O-Wisp off on Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta, or safely use Court Change on them. Blaze is often used in conjunction with Cinderace sets that opt for Will-O-Wisp, being able to force itself into Blaze range and fire off a boosted Pyro Ball, while Libero is typically chosen when wanting to utilise Cinderace's strong coverage options. 224 HP with 32 Attack EVs allows Cinderace to OHKO Tinkaton, Weavile, and uninvested Gholdengo, with a chance to also OHKO Rillaboom, while giving it the ability to live +2 Shadow Ball from Iron Valiant, Ting-Lu's Earthquake, and two of Bulky Nasty Plot Gholdengo's unboosted Shadow Balls. Maximum Attack and Speed EVs can be run to maximize Cinderace's offensive potential, letting it ensure a 2HKO on uninvested Kyurem and Galarian Slowking, as well as an OHKO on Iron Crown with Pyro Ball and Kingambit after Spikes damage.",
    "corviknight": "Corviknight is a solid defensive and utility Pokemon in the OU metagame. Its great typing, access to Roost, immunity to Spikes and Toxic Spikes, and neutrality to Stealth Rock allow it to stave off a number of key threats such as Meowscarada, Kingambit, and Landorus-T while granting its teammates safe switch-ins with its slow U-turn. Brave Bird lets Corviknight deal high damage to Iron Valiant, Ogerpon-W, Great Tusk, and Rillaboom and make progress against Ghost-type Pokemon like Dragapult, but Body Press makes use of Corviknight's high Defense to deal with Pokemon such as Kingambit and Hisuian Samurott more easily. Defog allows Corviknight to clear entry hazards against non-Gholdengo teams; it makes for a solid Defogger due to its positive matchup against hazard setters like Landorus-T and Glimmora. Moreover, thanks to Pressure, Corviknight can PP stall certain entry hazard setters such as Gliscor and Clefable, with it effectively having higher Defog PP than Stealth Rock or Spikes and making it effective at removing entry hazards against bulkier teams. U-turn allows Corviknight to pivot out of stalemates and bad matchups. It is particularly useful against Gliscor and Gholdengo, as Gliscor will be unable to cripple Corviknight's partner with Knock Off or Toxic, while Gholdengo will be unable to exploit Corviknight and its Air Balloon will be popped, allowing Corviknight's teammates such as Great Tusk to more easily make progress against it. However, either utility moves can be dropped for Iron Defense, which powers up Body Press and allows Corviknight to more reliably check Pokemon such as Kingambit, Dragonite, and Iron Defense Zamazenta lacking Roar. Leftovers allows Corviknight to continuously stay healthy and recover from potential Stealth Rock chip damage, which will wear it down over time. Alternatively, Rocky Helmet lets Corviknight punish key physical attackers such as Meowscarada, Weavile, Kingambit, and Zamazenta. 120 Speed EVs can be used to outspeed Adamant Kingambit and either set up Iron Defense or attack it with Body Press. However, Corviknight loses a considerable amount of bulk and its slow U-turn, which can be detrimental when pivoting to one of its teammates. Corviknight is a poor Terastallization candidate due to it losing its near-complete immunity to entry hazards. Nonetheless, it can use Tera to secure an endgame sweep with Iron Defense and Body Press or emergency check certain threats. Tera Dragon allows it to check foes like Cinderace and Ogerpon-W while retaining its Grass resistance against foes like Rillaboom. Tera Water similarly improves Corviknight's matchup against Fire-types such as Cinderace and Heatran with the added benefit of being sturdier against Weavile. Tera Fighting lets Corviknight check Kingambit better and powers up its Body Press. Tera Grass or Tera Dragon can also be used to improve Corviknight's matchup against Ogerpon-W.",
    "slowkinggalar": "Galarian Slowking is an excellent defensive pivot thanks to good Special Defense, Regenerator, and a solid defensive typing. Future Sight allows Galarian Slowking to pressure a number of offensive threats like Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Zamazenta and do significant damage to defensive foes like Toxapex and Clodsire and allows it to support its wallbreaking teammates further. Psychic Noise can be used to shut down the recovery from walls like Corviknight, Gliscor, and Garganacl while giving Galarian Slowking an immediate way to pressure foes like Zamazenta and Iron Moth, even going through the latter's Substitute. Chilly Reception alongside minimum Speed investment allows Galarian Slowking to serve as the metagame's slowest pivot, able to safely bring in offensive teammates safely while changing the weather to snow, which disrupts weather archetypes like rain and sun. Thunder Wave allows it to cripple fast offensive threats like Dragapult and Weavile while preventing Kingambit from freely switching into Galarian Slowking, while Toxic wears down opposing walls like Ting-Lu and Dondozo as well as Thunder Wave-immune targets like Raging Bolt and Zapdos. Tera Water lets Galarian Slowking stand up to powerful Fire-types like Cinderace as well as offensive Water-types like Walking Wake. Tera Grass similarly gives it a Water resistance against Walking Wake without being weak to Garganacl's Salt Cure and Raging Bolt; the Ground resistance can also be handy against foes like Great Tusk and Gliscor. Tera Fairy gives it an immunity to strong Dragon-type attacks from the likes of Walking Wake, Raging Bolt, and Dragapult while flipping its Dark weakness. 16 Defense EVs allow Galarian Slowking to live a Knock Off from Meowscarada.",
    "tinkaton": "Tinkaton is a good support option thanks to its access to a number of utility moves and solid defensive typing. Early in the game, Tinkaton makes for a good anti-lead, matching up well into other entry hazard setters like Clefable, Deoxys-S, and Ribombee and disrupting them with Encore while setting its own entry hazards. Encore also works well with Gigaton Hammer, allowing Tinkaton to punish foes that would take advantage of the passivity after the latter move is used to set up or recover HP. Thunder Wave can be run to punish Pokemon like Iron Moth and Ogerpon-W switching into Tinkaton, while Knock Off can be used instead to cripple foes like Moltres, Galarian Slowking, and Alomomola by removing their Heavy-Duty Boots. Ice Hammer is an option to pressure Gliscor, especially since it's unbothered by most of Tinkaton's moves. Air Balloon bypasses its Ground weakness against foes like Gliscor and Landorus-T, and it allows Tinkaton to check threats like Kyurem, Dragonite, and Enamorus that rely on their Ground coverage to deal with Steel-types. Pickpocket also allows Tinkaton to disrupt foes by stealing their item once its Air Balloon is popped, notably against U-turn users like Landorus-T and Dragapult that can pop Tinkaton's Air Balloon and lose their own item in the same turn. Mold Breaker can be used instead to let Tinkaton paralyze Gholdengo and Garganacl with Thunder Wave, set Stealth Rock against Hatterene, and even use Encore on all three of them. Tinkaton can utilize Tera Water to get rid of its Fire weakness, standing up to the likes of Cinderace and Iron Moth, and provide a Water resistance against Walking Wake. Tera Ghost can instead block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk and Iron Treads and emergency check Zamazenta. 232 Speed EVs allow Tinkaton to outspeed Landorus-T.",
    "gliscor": "Gliscor is a premier Spikes user in the metagame. The combination of Poison Heal and Protect allows it to outlast common entry hazard removal options such as Great Tusk and Cinderace, setting it apart from its peers. Gliscor can survive some of the strongest neutral attacks in the tier with ease, including a boosted Iron Moth's Fiery Dance, Choice Specs Dragapult's Shadow Ball, and Kingambit's Kowtow Cleave. Its immunity to status conditions helps it against more defensively oriented teams, allowing it to be unfazed by Toxic from opposing Gliscor, Galarian Slowking, and Clodsire or by Will-O-Wisp from Cinderace and Moltres. Earthquake gives it a reliable STAB move to immediately threaten foes like Raging Bolt, Kingambit, and Iron Moth. Toxic is used to whittle away at the foe’s health, as the combination of Toxic and Protect allows the poison damage to worsen while Gliscor heals itself in the process. Toxic also works well with Earthquake, as it can be used to pressure Toxic-immune foes like Clodsire, Galarian Slowking, and non-Air Balloon Gholdengo. Toxic is not always required though, as Knock Off can be substituted over it to remove foes' Heavy-Duty Boots, allowing teams that rely on hazard stacking to make progress, especially if the team lacks another Knock Off user. Knock Off also complements its Earthquake, as it can be used to pop Air Balloon from Steel-types like Kingambit, Gholdengo, and Tinkaton that can otherwise wall Gliscor. Protect is not just useful for giving Gliscor a free turn of recovery; it is also useful for scouting the moves of Choice-locked Pokemon that are able to break it, like Walking Wake and Kyurem. On stall teams, Poison Jab can be run instead to allow Gliscor to pressure Hatterene, which otherwise has an extremely favorable matchup against the team. A specially defensive EV spread with a Careful nature checks Pokemon like Heatran, Raging Bolt, and Gholdengo, retaining enough physical bulk to live Ogerpon-W's unboosted Ivy Cudgel from full. A physically defensive EV spread with an Impish nature can be run instead to let Gliscor check Pokemon like Great Tusk lacking Ice Spinner, Dragonite, and Zamazenta, and the Special Defense EVs provide enough special bulk to survive +1 Enamorus's Moonblast and +1 Raging Bolt's Dragon Pulse from full. Both sets run 244 HP EVs to maximize the amount of health Gliscor recovers from Poison Heal. Tera Water lets Gliscor flip bad matchups against Water-types like Walking Wake and Hisuian Samurott as well as Ice-types like Weavile while being a great defensive typing in general. Tera Ghost prevents Rapid Spin users like Great Tusk and Iron Treads from removing its Spikes and grants an immunity to Facade from Ursaluna, which is otherwise very problematic for the bulky teams that Gliscor fits in, as well as Body Press from Zamazenta. However, these are best reserved as a last resort, since Gliscor immensely appreciates its base typing because of its Stealth Rock neutrality and Spikes immunity. Moreover, Gliscor's teammates will generally get more mileage from Tera, so using it on Gliscor is not worth it most of the time.",
    "moltres": "Moltres is an excellent defensive Pokemon, being able to function as a sturdy physical wall and a pivot. Its typing and ability let it punish a multitude of physical attackers in the tier, threatening a burn with Flame Body to stop pivoting from U-turn or reliably walling the likes of Zamazenta lacking Stone Edge, Great Tusk, Enamorus, Rillaboom, and Iron Valiant. Hurricane can be used to threaten foes like Great Tusk, Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-W hard. Will-O-Wisp reliably cripples physical attackers like Terastallized Kingambit, Ogerpon-W, and Dragonite. Roar stops potential setup sweepers like Tera Fire Zamazenta and Iron Moth, as well as being a good way to deal passive damage if entry hazards are up. U-turn lets Moltres get in teammates safely. Scorching Sands can be used to hit foes like Iron Moth and Raging Bolt and can fish for burns against most physical attackers. Tera Fairy is a solid defensive typing that gives Moltres a Dark resistance while keeping its natural Fighting resistance, maintaining its positive matchup versus Zamazenta. This lets Moltres check Dark-type physical attackers like Weavile and Kingambit in a pinch. Tera Grass flips Moltres's weakness to Water into a resistance, giving it an easier rain matchup, as well as taking various hits like Hydro Steam from Walking Wake, Ivy Cudgel from Ogerpon-W, and Water-type moves from Primarina to Roar out Calm Mind variants. It also flips Moltres's Electric weakness against Raging Bolt, letting it phaze Calm Mind variants with Roar. Terastallization allows Moltres to ease its weakness to Knock Off and Stealth Rock, letting it not fear huge chip damage from them. 12 Speed EVs allow Moltres to outspeed Jolly Kingambit.",
    "ragingbolt": "Raging Bolt acts as a powerful offensive pivot and revenge killer that can also provide defensive utility thanks to its solid natural bulk and good typing. Thunderclap is one of the strongest options for priority in the metagame, allowing Raging Bolt to overcome its lackluster Speed tier and act as a strong revenge killer against the likes of Ogerpon-W, Enamorus, Darkrai, Deoxys-S, and Kingambit. Volt Switch makes Raging Bolt hard to pin down, allowing it to pivot on and wear down specially defensive walls such as Galarian Slowking, Iron Crown, and Blissey as they switch in. Draco Meteor is a viable alternative to Dragon Pulse for more immediate power, hitting some benchmarks like OHKOing opposing Raging Bolt and having a chance to OHKO bulky Great Tusk in exchange for a severe Special Attack drop. Taunt allows Raging Bolt to more effectively deal with special walls by stopping recovery attempts from the likes of Blissey and Clodsire and blocking utility moves from Clefable, Ting-Lu, and Galarian Slowking. Other options include Thunderbolt for a consistent Electric-type STAB move, 2HKOing neutral targets such as Clefable after little prior chip damage, defensive Zapdos, and Gholdengo while not forcing Raging Bolt to switch out, and Weather Ball on weather teams or alongside Galarian Slowking for alternative Ice-type coverage. Heavy-Duty Boots allows Raging Bolt to hit the field multiple times without worrying about entry hazards, which is especially good on teams that rely on ignoring hazards altogether, but Choice Specs is a viable alternative on teams with reliable hazard control options, hitting important damage benchmarks including 2HKOing Garganacl with Thunderbolt, OHKOing specially defensive Gliscor, Zamazenta, and Ogerpon-W with Draco Meteor, and 2HKOing Unaware Clodsire, Iron Treads, and Galarian Slowking with Draco Meteor, though it makes Raging Bolt unable to run Taunt. Tera Fairy allows Raging Bolt to turn the tables on matchups like Iron Defense Zamazenta, Iron Valiant, Dragapult, Kyurem, Walking Wake, and Great Tusk as well as giving it the option to run Tera Blast in order to hit Ting-Lu and Great Tusk super effectively. Another option is Tera Flying, granting an even better matchup against the likes of Great Tusk, Iron Treads, Landorus-T, and Ting-Lu, though it gives Raging Bolt some problematic weaknesses against opposing Raging Bolt, Zapdos, Weavile, and Meowscarada.",
    "gholdengo": "Choice Scarf Gholdengo is a great speed control option in the tier capable of outrunning and revenge killing premier offensive threats like Dragapult, Choice Specs Enamorus, and Weavile. Shadow Ball allows it to threaten foes like Galarian Slowking, Skarmory, and Dragapult, while Make It Rain, with its high Base Power, not only becomes challenging to switch into but also enables Gholdengo to effectively revenge kill Pokemon like Enamorus. Trick is a good utility move that allows it to Choice-lock Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Gliscor, hampering their effectiveness. Focus Blast enables Gholdengo to hit Dark-types like Kingambit, Hisuian Samurott, and Ting-Lu. Alternatively, Nasty Plot can be used to turn Gholdengo into a potent late-game cleaner once it has successfully used Trick to get rid of its Choice Scarf. In another vein, Recover can be utilized to keep Gholdengo healthy, especially against bulkier foes, once it has used Trick, allowing it to check them more consistently. Tera Fighting gives Gholdengo a resistance to Dark-type moves, most notably Sucker Punch from Kingambit, and it gives Focus Blast a STAB boost. Alternatively, Tera Flying can be used to help Gholdengo against Ground-types like Great Tusk and Gliscor.",
    "meowscarada": "Meowscarada is one of the tier's premier offensive pivots thanks to its stupendous Speed, a critical benchmark that lets it outspeed scary threats like Cinderace, Iron Valiant, Roaring Moon, and Serperior. Knock Off scares some of the tier's key dangers like Deoxys-S, Dragapult, and Gholdengo while simultaneously threatening to cripple other switch-ins like Hatterene and Corviknight. Flower Trick cuts through bulky threats such as Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Primarina, even ignoring the former two's potential Defense boosts, while Triple Axel gives Meowscarada a crucial Ice-type STAB move that allows it to nail common Pokemon such as Clodsire, Gliscor, Raging Bolt, and Roaring Moon. U-turn keeps up momentum while chipping switch-ins such as Kingambit and Hatterene. Heavy-Duty Boots is practically a requirement on this set, as Meowscarada will frequently be switching in and out of combat and is otherwise quite weak to hazards. Tera Grass and Dark enhance Flower Trick and Knock Off, while Tera Fire is an option that grants Meowscarada some crucial resistances to Fairy, Ice, and Steel-type attacks such as those from Enamorus, Darkrai, and Choice Scarf Gholdengo. Tera Electric is an additional option that allows Meowscarada to feast on Zapdos more effectively thanks to a newly gained Static immunity and resistance to both of its STAB moves.",
    "dragonite": "Dragon Dance Dragonite is among the tier's most elite setup sweepers thanks to its excellent coverage options, solid bulk augmented further by a great defensive typing and an incredible ability in Multiscale, and access to extremely powerful priority in Extreme Speed. Extreme Speed drastically improves Dragonite's matchups against faster offensive threats such as Iron Valiant, Iron Moth, Darkrai, and Ogerpon-W. It also outprioritizes Raging Bolt's Thunderclap and Weavile's Ice Shard, and gives it an option to pick off weakened offensive threats like Zamazenta. Tera Normal lets a +1 Dragonite's Extreme Speed frequently OHKO Ogerpon-W and Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKO Terastallized Raging Bolt. The boost from Tera Normal can also help Dragonite pick off greatly weakened threats like Kingambit, Zamazenta, and Kyurem in a pinch. A Normal typing gives Dragonite a Ghost immunity to take advantage of Gholdengo and Dragapult as well as a general lack of weaknesses to utilize alongside Roost to maintain Multiscale more reliably. However, it is important to note that Iron Defense Zamazenta gives this variant significant trouble. Tera Ground is a solid alternative that should always be run if Dragonite foregoes Extreme Speed, allowing it to muscle past bulkier Kingambit variants. Tera Ground also provides Dragonite with an immunity to Gholdengo's Thunder Wave and Iron Crown and Zapdos's Volt Switch and a resistance to Landorus-T and Zamazenta's Stone Edge. Tera Ground Earthquake is also Dragonite's strongest neutral attacking option, giving Dragonite the possibility to 2HKO unboosted all-out attacking Zamazenta variants. Ice Spinner pairs excellently with Earthquake, with the former hitting Grass-types like Rillaboom and Sinistcha and Flying-types like Landorus-T, Gliscor, Zapdos, and opposing Dragonite and the latter hitting Steel-types like Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Iron Crown that shrug off Extreme Speed and Ice Spinner. Either Extreme Speed or Ice Spinner can be dropped in favor of Roost. However, losing Extreme Speed's priority causes Dragonite to become extremely vulnerable to Booster Energy Iron Valiant, which outspeeds it even at +2. Similarly, foregoing Ice Spinner makes Dragonite significantly worse against Landorus-T, Gliscor, and Zapdos and leaves it completely walled by Air Balloon Gholdengo and Pecharunt. An assortment of alternate Tera types can be considered, particularly alongside Tera Blast, though this can make Dragonite's coverage options overly Tera-reliant. Tera Flying provides Dragonite with a devastating Tera Blast that hits Zamazenta super effectively and Great Tusk much harder than Ice Spinner. Tera Fire provides Dragonite with an immunity to burn attempts from Cinderace and Moltres, a coveted Ice resistance to assist against the likes of Kyurem and Weavile, and a Tera Blast that can super effectively hit Air Balloon Gholdengo and Kingambit. Lastly, Tera Fairy provides Dragonite with both a Dragon immunity and a super effective Tera Blast against all of Great Tusk, Zamazenta, Dragon-types like Kyurem and Dragapult, and Dark-types like Hisuian Samurott and Weavile. However, the added longevity from Roost is extremely useful in allowing Dragonite to take further advantage of Multiscale to set up multiple Dragon Dances. A Jolly nature allows a boosted Dragonite to outspeed and dispatch Dragapult, which is frequently used to revenge kill standard Adamant variants, though this comes with a noticeable loss of power.",
    "weavile": "Weavile is an excellent wallbreaker thanks to its high Speed and Attack and high-Base Power moves, including a Knock Off that Skarmory, Gliscor, and Clefable cannot safely absorb. Weavile also provides excellent speed control for teams, outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame besides Darkrai, Zamazenta, Dragapult, and Deoxys-S while being able to slot in Ice Shard to pick off faster threats like Dragapult and Choice Scarf Enamorus. Triple Axel's sheer power can be forgone for Icicle Crash's non-contact nature, preventing Weavile from being punished by Moltres's Flame Body and Zapdos's Static. Swords Dance allows Weavile to OHKO bulky Pokemon like defensive Great Tusk and Ting-Lu at +2 with Triple Axel and OHKO Enamorus and Dragapult after Stealth Rock with Ice Shard. Low Kick can be slotted over Swords Dance to OHKO opposing Weavile and Kingambit as well as hitting Hisuian Samurott super effectively, but dropping Swords Dance limits Weavile's power and leaves it always walled by Skarmory and Clefable. Tera Ice boosts Triple Axel and Ice Shard to increase its wallbreaking and revenge killing potential, with +2 Tera Ice Triple Axel OHKOing Clefable and most Skarmory variants after Stealth Rock damage and +2 Tera Ice Ice Shard OHKOing Dragonite. Tera Ghost provides an immunity from the revenge killing attempts of Zamazenta and Extreme Speed Dragonite.",
    "samurotthisui": "Hisuian Samurott establishes itself as a top-tier dedicated lead thanks to its signature move Ceaseless Edge, letting it threaten the opposition while reliably setting up layers of Spikes that bypass common entry hazard preventions such as Hatterene's Magic Bounce and Taunt from Deoxys-S and Landorus-T. It does so while still maintaining a decent offensive presence courtesy of its strong Sharpness-boosted STAB combination and a bevy of disruptive utility options. Though weaker, Aqua Cutter is a perfectly-accurate alternative over Razor Shell that notably ignores common contact effects like Landorus-T's Rocky Helmet, Heatran's Flame Body, and Zapdos's Static at the cost of potentially missing out on the 2HKO against Ting-Lu. Aqua Jet reliably picks off opposing Focus Sash leads like Deoxys-S, Glimmora, and Ribombee as well as targeting other faster Pokemon like Cinderace and Great Tusk. Alternatively, Sucker Punch lets Hisuian Samurott hit faster Water-resistant Pokemon like Ogerpon-W and Choice Specs Dragapult, the latter of which can be problematic in the offense mirror. Aside from being handy against bulky foes like Skarmory and Pelipper, Knock Off removing Heavy-Duty Boots works extremely well with Spikes, making the likes of Alomomola, Dondozo, and Unaware Clefable susceptible to them, which is especially helpful because the latter two can trouble the hyper offense teams that Hisuian Samurott supports. Either Taunt or Encore prevents Hisuian Samurott from being used as setup fodder by the likes of Raging Bolt and Kingambit, and it messes with defensive foes like Clefable. More specifically, Taunt stops Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and Skarmory from setting hazards and prevents slower offensive threats like Dragonite from setting up. Alternatively, Encore is better at punishing naturally faster setup sweepers like Iron Defense Zamazenta and Nasty Plot Darkrai looking for that one free turn of setup, and it can subsequently provide valuable switch-in and setup opportunities for an incoming teammate. Sacred Sword hits opposing Hisuian Samurott; cleanly OHKOes Weavile, Darkrai, and bulky Kingambit; and breaks IronPress Zamazenta's Substitute. Focus Sash guarantees at least one layer of Spikes can be set even against faster foes like Enamorus, as well as opposing leads like Ribombee. Tera Ghost is predominantly used to spinblock foes like Great Tusk and Iron Treads in a pinch. An EV spread of 232 Atk / 24 Def / 252 Spe is another option, running enough Defense EVs to survive Choice Band Dragapult's Dragon Darts from full, which has a chance to OHKO Hisuian Samurott through Focus Sash otherwise.",
    "dragapult": "Dragapult is one of OU's best pivots, with its massive base Speed stat allowing it to dance around slower threats, spread status and deal significant damage over the course of a game. Dragon Darts is a strong and reliable STAB option that notably pressures special walls like Blissey and Clodsire while denting Calm Mind Raging Bolt and Dragonite with Multiscale intact. Alternatively, Draco Meteor can be used with an EV spread fully invested into Special Attack that lets it secure an OHKO into Walking Wake while also giving Dragapult a more powerful Hex to 2HKO even max HP Gholdengo, but the Special Attack drop from Draco Meteor leaves it vulnerable to being used as setup fodder, and this set is also weaker into sweepers that boost their Special Defense such as Raging Bolt. Both Will-O-Wisp and Thunder Wave are great options that synergize with the rest of Dragapult's toolkit by doubling the power of Hex; Will-O-Wisp turns Dragapult into a great fast check that can outrun and neutralize physical threats such as Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Kingambit while also forcing chip on Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Clodsire that try to switch in, while Thunder Wave cripples burn-immune targets like Clefable and Cinderace and slows down special attackers like Darkrai, Iron Moth, and Iron Valiant to help teammates deal with them more easily. Tera Fairy is a great defensive option that flips Dragapult's Dragon weakness into an immunity while also granting a Dark resistance to resist hits from Kingambit and Darkrai, whereas Tera Ghost powers up Hex while still dropping its weaknesses to Fairy and Dragon to help block revenge killing attempts by Enamorus. The Attack EVs allow Dragapult to 2HKO Hisuian Samurott with Dragon Darts from full health.",
    "incineroar": "U-turn allows Incineroar to pivot on, chip away at, and not get taken advantage of by its checks like Swampert and Diancie. Earthquake, on the other hand, provides a powerful attack with no drawback that also hits the common Rock- and and Fire-types like Diancie, Dragalge, and Paldean Tauros-F. An Adamant nature can be used to allow Incineroar to 2HKO Alolan Muk, but a Jolly nature is useful for outspeeding foes like Modest Choice Specs Sylveon and unboosted Torterra. A specially defensive spread of 248 HP / 212 SpD / 48 Spe with a Careful nature can alternatively be used on Swords Dance sets, letting it better pivot into foes like Chandelure, Munkidori, and Meloetta; the Speed EVs let Incineroar outpace Alolan Muk. Tera Poison gives Incineroar an immunity to poison from Alolan Muk and Amoonguss while having a resistance to Fighting-type attacks. However, Tera Fairy provides a more well-rounded defensive typing that isn't weak to Ground-type attacks while still resisting Fighting-type attacks. Tera Ghost allows Incineroar to completely blank Close Combat, and it helps to revenge kill Cinccino. This comes at a trade-off of it having no other useful resistances, though.",
    "hawlucha": "Hawlucha acts as a threatening sweeper and late-game cleaner on Terrain teams. Thanks to Grassy Seed activating Unburden, Hawlucha becomes faster than the majority of the metagame, outpacing Choice Scarf and Booster Energy users like Darkrai and Iron Valiant and providing plenty of coverage with its Fighting / Flying STAB combination. Its serviceable bulk, along with a boost to its Defense due to Grassy Seed, allows Hawlucha to use Swords Dance in front of many common foes, such as Kingambit and Great Tusk. Encore can force switches and thwart recovery attempts by locking the foe into a resisted attack or a recovery move. Alternatively, Substitute can also give Hawlucha the breathing room it might need to set up against incoming status moves from Gliscor and deny Sucker Punch and Thunderclap from Kingambit and Raging Bolt, respectively. Psychic Seed is an alternative to enable Hawlucha on Psychic Terrain teams, granting it a valuable Special Defense boost that can help it set up in the face of special attackers like Iron Valiant. 124 EVs in Speed are enough to outspeed Sand Rush Excadrill after Unburden activates, and the bulk investment allows it to survive a Make It Rain from Gholdengo from full HP. Tera Flying is a great way to enhance Acrobatics's damage output; after a Swords Dance, Hawlucha can OHKO Zamazenta through Dauntless Shield with Tera Flying. Alternatively, Tera Electric can be used to withstand Zapdos, Raging Bolt, and Gholdengo, disallowing paralysis attempts and resisting their main attacks. Compared to Tera Electric, Tera Ground is an even better option to prevent Raging Bolt's revenge killing attempts at the cost of being vulnerable to Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Weavile's Ice Shard.",
    "ogerponwellspring": "With its Wellspring Mask-boosted power and good Speed tier alongside Swords Dance, Ogerpon-W is one of the most potent wallbreakers in the metagame. Generally, Power Whip is the better option, but at the cost of considerable power, it can opt for the more-accurate Horn Leech, which aids in recovering the chip damage it often takes from entry hazards throughout a game. However, it notably misses out on OHKOing Pelipper at +2 and Tera Water users like Galarian Slowking, Calm Mind Hatterene, and specially defensive Gliscor. Play Rough augments Ogerpon-W's coverage by allowing it to hit targets such as Dragapult, Hydrapple, and Dragonite. Alternatively, Encore generates setup opportunities by locking foes into undesirable moves, such as Roost and Iron Defense from Corviknight or Skarmory, Sucker Punch from Kingambit, and Thunderclap from Raging Bolt. Knock Off can be used instead, which has the utility of removing items such as Dragonite's Heavy-Duty Boots and Skarmory's Rocky Helmet all while still hitting Dragapult, and it notably lands an OHKO after a Swords Dance versus defensive Gholdengo. Trailblaze is also an option; the boost to Ogerpon-W's Speed improves its ability to sweep, preventing it from being revenge killed by the likes of Weavile, Meowscarada, and Dragapult. Water Absorb allows it to take advantage of foes like Barraskewda and Alomomola using Flip Turn, preventing them from generating momentum, while its Scald immunity lets it freely set up on Alomomola. Tera Water is forced and bolsters the strength of Ivy Cudgel to absurd levels; after a Swords Dance, this allows it to OHKO Kingambit as well as Skarmory and Corviknight after Stealth Rock. In conjunction with the Special Defense boost granted by Embody Aspect, Tera Water has useful defensive properties too, allowing Ogerpon-W to check the likes of Iron Moth, Calm Mind Iron Valiant, and Gholdengo in a pinch.",
    "glimmora": "Glimmora is one of the tier's premier leads thanks to its ability to set up Stealth Rock and deny opposing entry hazards with Mortal Spin, all while scaring foes from activating Toxic Debris in the process. Toxic Debris's potential to set up Toxic Spikes can prove lethal against certain teams, particularly more offensive ones due to the lack of offensive Poison-types in OU outside of Iron Moth able to absorb them. Mortal Spin's side effect of inflicting poison detracts Pokemon such as Ting-Lu from setting up entry hazards multiple times and Hatterene from trying to deny Stealth Rock with Magic Bounce. Power Gem lets Glimmora hit most targets for decent damage, and notably chips at Corviknight, Skarmory, and Gliscor that would otherwise wall Glimmora, with Corviknight also removing its entry hazards with Defog. Earth Power allows Glimmora to hit Steel-types such as Gholdengo, Kingambit, and Heatran, which otherwise are able to block Mortal Spin, with the former two also resisting Power Gem. Mud Shot is another option over Earth Power, as its side effect of lowering the foe's Speed allows Glimmora to win the mirror matchup against opposing Glimmora. Mud Shot can also slow down foes trying to use Glimmora as setup fodder, such as Iron Valiant and Ogerpon-W, preventing them from getting out of hand. Focus Sash allows Glimmora to survive any one hit and thus be able to set up Stealth Rock safely. Red Card can be used instead, allowing Glimmora to make use of its natural bulk and typing to take a hit and thus phaze setup sweepers like Iron Valiant and Iron Moth—which is notable in the hyper offense mirror—preventing its team from getting overrun by boosted offensive threats. Red Card is also useful to disrupt the opposing team, potentially forcing a foe out to take Stealth Rock or Toxic Spikes damage. Tera Ghost grants Glimmora with an immunity to Rapid Spin from the likes of Great Tusk and Iron Treads, denying their attempts from removing Glimmora's entry hazards.",
    "mamoswine": "Ice Shard threatens faster Ice-weak Pokemon like Galarian Zapdos, Cyclizar, and Salamence, outright OHKOing Noivern and Flygon. It's similarly useful for picking off frail threats like Maushold and Hisuian Zoroark and weakened out-of-control setup sweepers like Gyarados and Terrakion. Knock Off punishes switch-ins like Slowbro, Vaporeon, and Umbreon, softening them up and making them vulnerable to entry hazards and chip damage. Alternatively, Stealth Rock allows Mamoswine to make progress even against physical walls like Galarian Weezing and Cresselia. Heavy-Duty Boots is standard to give Mamoswine more opportunities to switch in repeatedly. Never-Melt Ice lets Mamoswine 2HKO Hippowdon with Icicle Crash and gives it a chance to KO Slither Wing with Icicle Crash after it switches into Earthquake. Tera Fire grants a key burn immunity to Mamoswine so it can break down Galarian Weezing and Talonflame without fear, and it lets Mamoswine tank Iron Head from Jirachi and First Impression from Slither Wing in a pinch. Tera Ice powers up Mamoswine's Ice-type moves to let it pull off feats like OHKOing Cyclizar with Ice Shard after Stealth Rock damage and 2HKOing Galarian Weezing after Stealth Rock damage when it's equipped with the Never-Melt Ice.",
    "comfey": "With access to Triage, Draining Kiss, and Terastallization granting it perfect offensive coverage, Comfey is a formidable sweeper in UU, taking down dangerous offensive foes like Lokix, Quaquaval, and Greninja. Calm Mind amplifies the power of Comfey's Draining Kiss while also making it harder to take down, finding setup chances against common foes like Hydrapple, Tornadus-T, and Rotom-W. Tera Blast Ground allows Comfey to now target Steel-types, including Metagross, Excadrill, and Tinkaton as well as other Fairy-resistant Pokemon such as Toxapex, Pecharunt, Skeledirge, and Hisuian Arcanine. Tera Ground also grants Comfey the ability to set up on foes like Sandy Shocks and Thundurus-T and resist Poison-type attacks from Pecharunt. Taunt denies recovery chances against foes like Slowking, Toxapex, and Mandibuzz, notably blocking Toxic attempts from the latter two, allowing Comfey to set up Calm Mind more easily and capitalize on forced switches. Giga Drain is an option over Taunt to get heavy damage on Water-types such as Azumarill and Slowking as well as other foes like Mamoswine, Rhyperior, and Hisuian Arcanine. A Life Orb grants Comfey an immediate power boost and works in tandem with the self-healing nature of Draining Kiss. 16 Speed EVs let Comfey outspeed foes such as Volcanion and Metagross, with the remaining investment in HP and Special Attack to maximize bulk and power.",
    "irontreads": "Iron Treads serves as a major player in the entry hazard metagame and an excellent lead for offense teams due to its Speed, Stealth Rock, and ability to remove hazards from opposing leads like Glimmora and Deoxys-S with Rapid Spin. Its Steel typing blocks Mortal Spin from Glimmora, and it naturally outspeeds Landorus-T, which can use Taunt to prevent hazards from slower leads. A special set with Earth Power allows Iron Treads to KO Glimmora without activating Toxic Debris, while Steel Beam's self-KO allows it to block Rapid Spin from Great Tusk, Defog from Corviknight, and gives safe entry for an incoming teammate while still threatening Hatterene from switching in to prevent its Stealth Rock. Volt Switch is also an option to bring in its teammate safely without KOing itself in the process. Booster Energy's Speed boost allows Iron Treads to set Stealth Rock against Deoxys-S, grants it more opportunities to use Rapid Spin, and allows it to pick off various otherwise faster Pokemon, notably Cinderace, which could otherwise use Court Change before Iron Treads could attack. Eject Button is an option that can be used on teams for additional momentum at the cost of effectiveness in the hazard game. Tera Ghost prevents Rapid Spin from Great Tusk and opposing Iron Treads to keep its hazards and gives Iron Treads an immunity to Fighting Fighting-type moves that would otherwise KO it, including Close Combat from Zamazenta and Iron Valiant.",
    "rillaboom": "With its combination of power, strong priority, solid bulk, and excellent support through Grassy Terrain, Rillaboom is a premier wallbreaker and revenge killer in OU. Grassy Glide allows Rillaboom to revenge kill faster Pokemon like Iron Boulder, Great Tusk, and Barraskewda while also denying lead Deoxys-S and Hisuian Samurott from getting two turns to set entry hazards. Wood Hammer is an excellent tool for breaking through even resistant Pokemon, being able to 2HKO Raging Bolt and Kingambit after Stealth Rock while OHKOing Dondozo, Great Tusk, and Hatterene. U-turn makes Rillaboom a pivot while also being the strongest option against Lokix and Hydrapple. Knock Off removes items from Rillaboom's checks, including Dragonite, Skarmory, and Moltres, while also being the best option to hit Gholdengo, Skeledirge, and Galarian Slowking. Drain Punch is an alternative that OHKOes Kingambit and hits Heatran switching in while increasing Rillaboom's longevity. An Adamant nature is preferred for its power boost; however, a Jolly nature can be used to outspeed opposing Adamant Rillaboom and Gholdengo without Choice Scarf at the cost of being unable to always OHKO Pokemon like Dondozo and Galarian Slowking with Wood Hammer and Knock Off. An alternative EV spread of 172 HP / 252 Atk / 84 Spe can be used alongside an Adamant nature to outspeed Gliscor while allowing Rillaboom to survive hits such as Life Orb Deoxys-S's Psycho Boost, Ogerpon-W's +2 Power Whip, and Tornadus-T's Bleakwind Storm; however, it notably worsens Rillaboom's matchup against opposing Rillaboom and Raging Bolt due to being outsped. Tera Grass powers up Rillaboom's Grass-type moves, allowing Grassy Glide to OHKO Darkrai, Ogerpon-W, and Iron Valiant after Stealth Rock and Wood Hammer to OHKO Clefable, Toxapex, and Gliscor after Stealth Rock.",
    "primarina": "Assault Vest Primarina is a great special wall and slow pivot while being a remarkable offensive threat itself. Assault Vest allows Primarina to tank strong super effective hits like Serperior's Leaf Storm and Iron Moth's Sludge Wave, along with the ability to check threats like Walking Wake, Dragapult, and Iron Valiant. Surf and Moonblast hit the majority of the metagame for neutral or super effective damage, where Surf hits the Steel- and Fire-types such as Gholdengo and Cinderace that resist Moonblast, and Moonblast hits Dragon-types such as Dragapult that resist Surf. Flip Turn allows Primarina to slow pivot a teammate in after a foe has attacked, and it can also be used on predicted switches to gain momentum. Psychic Noise blocks healing from special walls like Blissey, Clodsire, and Clefable, allowing Primarina to chip them down for itself and its partners. 176 Speed EVs let Primarina outspeed Adamant Kingambit and Ursaluna, while the remaining HP EVs allow Primarina to reach feats such as surviving Protosynthesis Thunderbolt from Raging Bolt, +1 Speed Booster Energy Iron Moth's Sludge Wave, +2 Gliscor's Earthquake, and two Heavy Slams from Zamazenta. Tera Steel turns two of Primarina's major weaknesses, Poison and Grass, into an immunity and a resistance, respectively. This can be useful against moves like Rillaboom's Grassy Glide and Iron Moth's Sludge Wave. Tera Steel also provides a resistance to Stealth Rock, letting it pivot around more freely. However, Tera Steel negatively affects its matchup into Fire- and Fighting-types like Cinderace and Great Tusk. Tera Grass aids Primarina's matchup into Ogerpon-W and can help it against Raging Bolt in a pinch too; however, do note that Tera Grass still leaves it vulnerable to Galarian Slowking.",
    "rotomheat": "Rotom-H is a solid wallbreaker that offers a lot of utility, both offensively and defensively, in comparison to stronger special attackers like Delphox and bulkier pivots like Bellibolt. With its typing, bulk, and access to Levitate, Rotom-H can easily switch into walls like Mudsdale and Altaria as well as offensive threats like Arcanine and either set up on them or pivot with Volt Switch. Pain Split makes Rotom-H more adept at dismantling defensive teams, simultaneously keeping it healthy and helping it overwhelm special walls like Assault Vest Galarian Slowbro and Florges. The move is an inconsistent source of recovery, though, so Rotom-H shouldn't rely on it too heavily. Investing in HP maximizes the mileage Rotom-H gets from its defensive profile and also gives it an easier time setting up and sticking around. Overheat's high Base Power means that it hits hard even without Special Attack investment. Thunderbolt and Discharge are alternatives to Volt Switch that are better suited for wallbreaking, don't force Rotom-H to switch out, and can paralyze foes, but pivoting with Volt Switch is a huge part of Rotom-H's viability. Tera Steel makes Rotom-H immune to poison, letting it set up on Toxic users like Bellibolt and Gligar, and resist Stealth Rock in case it loses its Heavy-Duty Boots. It also helps Rotom-H stomach boosted attacks from the likes of Galarian Articuno, Espeon, and Dudunsparce while keeping most of its natural resistances. Tera Poison maintains the Toxic immunity in addition to flipping the script on Fighting-types like Paldean Tauros-F and Pawmot. Both options synergize well with Levitate, though Tera Poison leaves Rotom-H open to Psychic-type moves from the likes of Galarian Slowbro and Calm Mind Florges.",
    "sinistcha": "Calm Mind Sinistcha leverages its valuable defensive profile and tremendous longevity to set up easily while doubling up as a sturdy physical wall. It notably checks common physical attackers like Zamazenta, Rillaboom, and Ogerpon-W, as well as Ursaluna—the last two of which are especially problematic against the bulky teams that Sinistcha fits on. Additionally, it importantly spinblocks Great Tusk and Iron Treads. On top of weakening them with Strength Sap, Sinistcha can tip the scales even further by crippling them with Matcha Gotcha's burn while keeping itself exceptionally healthy in the process. The burn also helps in dissuading otherwise dangerous threats like Kingambit, Weavile, and Meowscarada from switching in freely and chips down bulky foes such as Corviknight and Tinkaton. Additionally, its freedom to use Matcha Gotcha and Strength Sap consistently is exacerbated further by its positive matchup against Hatterene and Psychic Noise users like Iron Crown and Primarina. Heatproof lets it set up on the likes of Cinderace and Moltres lacking Roar and Hurricane if necessary. Heavy-Duty Boots improves Sinistcha's matchup against opposing entry hazard stacking teams, but Leftovers or Colbur Berry can considered on teams with strong hazard removal; Leftovers lets Sinistcha set up more easily, while Colbur Berry allows it to comfortably take on the Dark-type coverage from foes it's supposed to check, like Zamazenta, Ogerpon-W, and Rillaboom, as well as strong Dark-types like Darkrai and Hisuian Samurott. Tera Poison grants a Toxic immunity from Pokemon like Gliscor and Galarian Slowking, especially since it can still beat most Ground-types like Gliscor, Ting-Lu, and defensive Landorus-T one-on-one looking to exploit its newfound weakness. Tera Fairy gives an overall great defensive typing, notably letting it stave off the tier's plethora of Dark- and Dragon-types like Hisuian Samurott and Dragapult as well as Knock Off from Pokemon like Rillaboom and Swords Dance Iron Valiant in a pinch. Both Tera types also maintain its ability to handle Fighting-types like Zamazenta and Iron Valiant, with Tera Poison letting it stomach the latter's Moonblast as well. The Speed EVs let Sinistcha outspeed Adamant Kingambit and Ursaluna.",
    "greattusk": "Great Tusk stands out as a great offensive threat and the tier's premier entry hazard remover thanks to its excellent Attack stat, movepool, defensive typing, and access to Rapid Spin. Ice Spinner allows it to destroy foes resistant to its STAB moves, such as Gliscor, Landorus-T, and Dragonite. Rapid Spin, in addition to clearing hazards, enables Great Tusk to outpace Pokemon like Kyurem and Darkrai. Great Tusk can further compress roles as the team's entry hazard setter with Stealth Rock, but the move can be dropped if a different setter is present on the team. Knock Off hinders opposing teams and is quite spammable because of Great Tusk's ability to threaten the metagame's premier Knock Off absorber, Gliscor, with Ice Spinner. It is especially useful for hazard-stacking teams that Great Tusk fits on, allowing it to remove Heavy-Duty Boots from foes like Moltres and Zapdos. Knock Off also hampers foes like Air Balloon Gholdengo, Primarina, and opposing Great Tusk. Alternatively, Close Combat can be used over Knock Off to hit certain Pokemon harder, such as Ting-Lu, Hisuian Samurott, Corviknight, Kyurem, and Tera Normal Gliscor. Heavy-Duty Boots maximizes its hazard removal prowess, allowing it to use Rapid Spin freely without worrying about taking damage from hazards on the field. Rocky Helmet lets Great Tusk punish physical attackers such as Zamazenta and Dragonite. Alternatively, Booster Energy bolsters its wallbreaking ability, allowing it to reach thresholds like OHKOing Gliscor with Ice Spinner. Tera Steel aids Great Tusk defensively, allowing it to resist Grass-type moves from foes like Ogerpon-W and Rillaboom as well as Ice-type moves from Pokemon such as Kyurem and Darkrai; it also helps Great Tusk against Hisuian Samurott and Iron Valiant's Moonblast. Tera Ground improves its wallbreaking potential, allowing non-Booster Energy Great Tusk to 2HKO +1 All-Out Attacker Zamazenta with Headlong Rush and its Booster Energy variants to 2HKO Alomomola; getting rid of its Fighting-type also helps it against foes like Iron Valiant and Clefable while maintaining its immunity to Thunderclap. Tera Fire enables Great Tusk to circumvent being burnt by Pokemon like Dragapult and Moltres while giving it an Ice resistance, helping it against Kyurem and Darkrai; it also allows Great Tusk to handle Fire-types better, like Iron Moth and Cinderace."
